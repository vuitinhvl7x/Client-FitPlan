              Everything used to be complicated. Finding the right workout felt
              like a chore, and staying motivated was a constant struggle. But
              somewhere along the way, we realized that fitness shouldn't be a
              burden. It should be accessible, enjoyable, and tailored to you.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-400 mb-4">

              platform that connects you with personalized workout plans
              designed by certified trainers. By combining cutting-edge
              technology with a deep understanding of human movement, we built
              FitPlan to make your fitness journey seamless and effective.
